**Car Marketplace**

Hello everyone! I just want to let you know, this is my first react project: Car Marketplace!
To build this, I use React, Tailwind + Shadcn UI, Drizzle ORM (to store the database), Supabase (to store the image), and I use Clerk for user login.
Of course this website still have a lot of thing to improve, and I hope you don't mind about it haha.
btw, here is the link: https://percobaantutu.github.io/car-marketplace/

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
